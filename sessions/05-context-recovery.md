# Session: Context Recovery

Paste this into a new agent session when you've lost context mid-project.

---

```text
Read these files in order:
1. AGENT.md
2. ROADMAP.md
3. updates/ — read the current month's file (YYYY-MM.md)

You are recovering context for this project. Do NOT make any changes.

## Steps

1. Summarise your understanding of:
   - What the project is and its North Star
   - What has been completed recently (from updates/ and roadmap)
   - What is currently in progress (from roadmap "Now" section)
   - What is coming next (from roadmap "Next" section)

2. Check the current git state:
   - Which branch am I on?
   - Are there uncommitted changes?
   - What were the last 5 commits?

3. If there is active feature work (something in "Now" with In Progress status):
   - Read the spec, plan, and tasks for that feature
   - Summarise what has been done and what remains
   - Identify the next task to pick up

4. Present a concise briefing:
   - Project state (1-2 sentences)
   - Current work (what's in flight)
   - Recommended next action
   - Any blockers or issues spotted

5. Ask me to confirm before taking any action.
