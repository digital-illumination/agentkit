# [PROJECT NAME] Constitution

**Version**: 1.0.0

## Purpose
[PROJECT NAME] exists to [core mission statement - one sentence describing why this project exists].

## Product Principles
- [Principle 1, e.g., "Security first. Never trade security for convenience without explicit user consent."]
- [Principle 2, e.g., "Privacy by default. Collect only what is needed and protect it."]
- [Principle 3, e.g., "Simplicity over features. Each addition must earn its complexity."]
- [Principle 4, e.g., "Accessible to all. Meet WCAG 2.1 AA as a baseline."]
- [Principle 5, e.g., "Transparent operations. Users should understand what the system does with their data."]

## Engineering Principles
- Spec-driven development with clear scopes and acceptance criteria.
- Defensive design for error handling and data integrity.
- No silent data loss. Failures must be visible and recoverable.
- Clear audit trails for significant operations.
- Prefer boring, proven technology over novelty.
- Test coverage must map to spec acceptance scenarios.

## Non-Negotiables
- [Hard constraint 1, e.g., "Never store raw passwords server-side."]
- [Hard constraint 2, e.g., "Never log sensitive user data."]
- [Hard constraint 3, e.g., "No production secrets in the repository."]
- [Hard constraint 4, e.g., "All API endpoints require authentication."]
