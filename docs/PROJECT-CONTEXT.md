### Integration Notation Guide

Use these markers when documenting integrations:

| Marker | Meaning |
|--------|---------|
| `(confirmed)` | Verified in code, config, or by stakeholder |
| `(inferred)` | Deduced from code analysis but not confirmed |
| `(Assumption: [detail])` | Not verified — treat as uncertain |
| `TBD` | Unknown — needs investigation |

**Rules:**
- If a field cannot be verified, use `TBD` or mark as `(Assumption)`
- Never state assumed details as facts
- Update markers to `(confirmed)` once verified
